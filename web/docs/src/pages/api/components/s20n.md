# S20n component

The S20n component has as sole purpose to init the translation library with your config.

It replaces, for the sake of simplicity, the [`initS20n`](api/function/initS20n) function.

`src/routes/$layout.svelte` (with typescript):

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    // Some imports...
    import S20n, { LanguageFile } from "s20n";

    // Some code...

    const locales: LanguageFile[] = [
        { path: "/static/locales/fr.json", name: "fr"},
        { path: "/static/locales/en.json", name: "en"},
        // other locales
    ]
</script>

<S20n {locales}/>
