# Power Translate

S20n provides a super efficient way to write translations: you can simply navigate through the ui with a `PowerTranslate` component enabled, and all missing translations will be appear on the screen where you'll be able to translate them right in place.

Try it:

<Tr t="Some string that has no translation. Add one!"/>
