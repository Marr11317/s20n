# S20n

Ultra-lightweight and configurable svelternationalization (s20n) library.

With S20n, translating is as easy as

```html
<Tr t="Please S20n, could you translate this string?"/>
```

No nested keys, no fallback needed. Only what you want translated.

And the result:

<script>
    import { Tr, locale } from 's20n';
</script>
> <Tr t="Please S20n, could you translate this string?"/>

Now look at the center of the topbar. There is a translate sign. Click on it and see this last sentence getting translated.
